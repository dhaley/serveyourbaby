# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# Use name-based virtual hosting.

# To make the VirtualDocumentRoot work, you also need to uncomment the
# following line in Drupal's .htaccess: # RewriteBase /

#
# You can still do overrides on a per case basis, for example when the
# pattern of your web application does not match your
# VirtualDocumentRoot pattern. Such is the case of Drupal sites hosted
# on the Acquia cloud hosting infrastructure.
